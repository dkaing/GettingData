# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 
by Davin Kaing

# Background of Acquired Data
The data used for this project, "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset," [1] is acquired from UCI database. For this study, participants were asked to perform six activities: walking on a plane field, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing up, and laying down. From these activities, the experimenters captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 70% of participants contributed to the training data and 30% contributed to the test data. 

# Project Description
This repository includes the course assignment that is part of the course, Gettting and Cleaning Data (offered through Coursera). The objective of this project is to clean the data and present them in a tidy manner. This is done by: (1) first merging two sets of data to create one data set, (2) extracting only measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, (3) using descriptive names to name the activities in the data set, (4) appropriately labeling the data set with description variable names, and (5) creating a second tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

# Project Components 
There are three files for this project: README.md, CODEBOOK.md, and run_analysis.R. The codebook describes the variables in the data and the coding used to processed the data. The "run_analysis.R" file contains the code used to clean the data.

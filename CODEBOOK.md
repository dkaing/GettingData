# Background of Acquired Data
The data used for this project, "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset," [1] is acquired from UCI database. For this study, participants were asked to perform six activities: walking on a plane field, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing up, and laying down. From these activities, the experimenters captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 70% of participants contributed to the training data and 30% contributed to the test data. As of the measurements, the accelerometer and gyroscope were used. 

# Variable Descriptions
 [1] "Subject" - there are 30 subjects in this experiment and each subject performed 6 tasks.                                       
 [2] "ActivityLabel" - the variable labels describe their performed tasks: "Walking", "WalkingUpstairs", "WalkingDownstairs", "Sitting", "Standing", and "Laying".                                  
 
 Variables [3] to variables [68] are the measured values.
